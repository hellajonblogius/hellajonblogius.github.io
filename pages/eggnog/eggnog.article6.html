            A Billionaire's Guide to Halloween

        <h3 class="maintext" style="color: antiquewhite">
            With Halloween coming up, many unsuspecting billionaires will fall victim to classic monsters, ghouls, and
            demons. Here's a guide on how to outgun the vile creatures that will rear their heads this season.
            <br><br>

            Internal Revenue Service (IRS)<br>
            To avoid this wretched beast, all you need is a clever accountant. Pay them well, and you won't have to
            relinquish your green to those meddling rodents.

            </div>
            <br>
            Federal Trade Commission (FTC)<br>
            The FTC is a truly dangerous syndicate. Operating at it's full potential, the FTC can extinguish your plans
            like water to fire. They have a tendency to dabble in dark magic such as Anti-Trust. However, there's always
            something a billionaire can do. The most effective way to avoid the sightline of the FTC is to infiltrate it
            with your own men via lobbying. Pay out those slimy bastards: their cheap whores too! They fold under a few
            thousand smackers.

            </div>
            Labor Unions<br>
            Peasants, peasants, peasants. These fools only have power in numbers and are best dealt with preemptively.
            Keep a keen ear out for whispers between employees. Intimidate, isolate, and infiltrate groups of weaselly
            workers.
            <br>
            <div class="box" style="width: min-content">
                <img src="../../assets/Billionaire Halloween/union.png" alt="union">
            </div>
            <br>
            Worker Strikes<br>
            If you've failed to suppress unionization, the worms will likely try to squeeze better pay, benefits, or
            treatment out of you. This fight can be easily won if you consider this: You have more money than them.
            Bleed them out over a few months and they'll come crawling back.
