        &nbsp After finishing one of the greatest shows ever made, Better Call Saul, I had a burning desire to let people know how great the show is.
        I preached from the rooftops: "Hark! Watch Better Call Saul! Watch Better Caul Saul!"
        I had nothing but the best intentions, hoping my peers would embark on the great journey that I was so lucky to engage in.
        However, after months of practically begging my friends to watch the show (one of the greatest shows ever made, keep in mind), I started to become desperate.
        <br><br>
        Enter: Vinnie. The four-eyed, blue-toed, degenerate chronic gambler.
        Always one to smell out opportunities to inspire suffering, the Italian devil sensed my desperation and decided to entertain my plea.
        I must admit, I am not proud of what I did next. I was so desperate for someone, anyone, to watch Better Call Saul that I came up with the worst deal in human history.
        Out of sheer goodwill towards my fellow man, I offered to watch all of Vinnie's oh-so-precious One Piece if he could finish all of Better Call Saul.
        As I shook the devils hand, the stakes hit me for the first time. What have I done? All of One Piece? Over 1,000 episodes?
        How could I be so foolish? I am still deeply sickened by the weakness I displayed on that day.
        <br><br>
        However, Vinnie is nothing if not noncommittal. I waiting anxiously for months. He updated me frequently and seemed to be making progress.
        When he finally told me he was on the last season, I began to accept my fate. I had nightmares that night. After a few weeks, however, he had still not finished the show.
        Am I free? Was this contract delayed by the sloth of the beast?
        Months and months past and I eventually relaxed, hoping that he would never return to the show (one of the greatest shows of all time, Better Call Saul).
        But, not unlike Jimmy McGill, what I should've realized is that I cannot outrun the consequences of my decisions.
        <br><br>
        Today, I was informed that Vinnie has finished Better Call Saul. It is with a heavy heart that I resign myself to the whims of fate. I will see you someday, on the other side of the pirate-ridden sea.
