        <h3 class="maintext" style="color: antiquewhite">
            I'm sick to death of Spotify. I refuse to pay for premium, so I have to listen to 2 minutes of ads for every
            40 seconds of music. And the ads on Spotify are second only to youtube in terms of degeneracy, and that's
            only because 90% of youtube ads are outright illegal.
            <br><br>
            Every single spotify ad seems to be designed to make me angry. They are fucking stupid and 10x louder than
            the music, so everytime an ad comes on my ears get blown out by some fucking jack off voice actor with a
            dead soul. There are three types of spotify ads: Spotify Premium ads, music ads, and normal corporate ads.
            Let's start with spotify premium ads. Ads for premium basically just taunt you with how shit their free
            service is. They point out that on the free version, you have to listen to obnoxious adds, you can't choose
            what songs you listen to, and that you're a broke fucking low life scumbag with no prospects. Onto the music
            ads. These are ads that artists record and send to spotify to produce and distribute. The problem with these
            types of ads is that every single one of these dipshit artists record their lines on a laptop microphone
            from 1996. You would think these motherfuckers, WHO RECORD AUDIO FOR A LIVING, would have access to a
            microphone from the 21st century. Sometime they quality is so bad that it literally hurts my ears.
            <br><br>
            Finally, there are the normal corporate ads. Somehow, I'd rather listen to spotfy's ear rape and poor
            shaming than another fast food ad. These ads sound like they were written by a fucking alien. They must be
            some of the most out of touch ads I've every had the displeasure of experiencing. It's mostly fast food
            brands.
            <br><br>
            The two that get my goat the most are Chick-fil-a and Zaxby's. Chick-fil-a hires these fucking clowns to
            talk about how much they love slop for 50 god forsaken minutes. "My favorite part about the Chick-fil-a
            chicken sandwich is the juicy chicken and the single pickle and the greasy bun." That's just the whole
            fucking sandwich you ingrate. You can't describe the entire sandwich and present it as your favorite part of
            the sandwich. And these mother fuckers talk about pretzel buns like they're some space-age technology.
            WENDY'S HAS BEEN DOING THAT SHIT SINCE I WAS IN THE 6TH GRADE. These bitches are trying to convince me that
            they reinvented food with that one. Fucking pricks.
            <br><br>
            The same shit goes for the Zaxby's ads. "What makes a Zaxby's chicken taco a Zaxby's chicken taco? First, we
            huck a chicken tender into a white flour tortilla that tastes like a towel, then we take a shit on it, and
            finally we take your money you disguising, piece-of-shit American hog." STOP IT I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS
            BULLSHIT. Why do they have to pretend like they're making a 5-star meal? It's so fucking condescending. And
            then they go "Get your shit-ridden limp-dick 'taco' for only $149.99! THAT'S RIGHT, ONLY $149.99!" like I'm
            not on the shit end of the treaty of Versailles. Bitch, if I had money to throw at your fuck-ass taco then I
            WOULND'NT BE USING THE FREE VERSION OF SPOTIFY.
            <br><br>
            But it's not just the ads. What's arguably worse then the ads is the shuffle mode. The free version of
            spotify has no way to listen to music other than on shuffle. But it doesn't shuffle the playlist, album, or
            artist you select. It just does whatever the fuck it wants. I will choose an album to listen to, it will
            play maybe 3 songs from that album, then it chooses one of two options: Play songs exclusively from an
            entirely separate artist for the next 30 minutes, or play your selected artists top songs in the same order
            every fucking time. I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE I JUST FUCKING CAN'T. I WANT TO DRIVE INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC WHEN
            THIS SHIT HAPPENS IT'S A SAFETY HAZARD. The only way around this quirky little FUCKING feature is to select
            a different album or artist just to delay the inevitable. WHICH IS ALSO A SAFETY HAZARD BECAUSE BITCH I AM
            NOT USING YOUR DOGASS APP UNLESS IM DRIVING.
            <br><br>
            In conclusion, Spotify treats its customers like a Tuesday night whore and I'm going back to MP3 players.
