            I like Garfield as much as the next guy, but let's cut the bullshit: Garfield's a money laundering scheme.
            <br><br>
            You're telling me that a cat with an incel owner has become one of the most recognizable characters in the
            world completely organically? No, I don't believe it. Jim Davis was a drug dealer or something and probably
            thought it'd be funny to use his little cat drawings as a means to launder his money. Let's go over the
            plain and simple facts: Garfield has 6 movies. No one can convince me that this fat fuck is exciting enough
            to star in 6 movies. "A cat? That likes lasagna? That's gold!" Like who are they fooling? This guy's in
            every Walmart in America looking at me like he's all that—like he earned it!
            <br><br>
            Who the fuck is orchestrating
            this operation? Jim Davis is 80 years old; there's no way he's slinging anymore, so it's gotta be 20th
            Century Fox. But I know better than to fuck with Fox's legal team so I'm just gonna reiterate the facts and
            let you come to your own conclusions: incel + lasagna + mondays = 6 movies, walmart, adoration? Yeah, okay
            pal, real convincing.
