            A wretch is one with a misery tied within their soul, one who is cursed at birth to a destiny of sorrow. By
            a wretch’s first steps, he understands his undue fate.
            <br><br>
            Where a man’s life paints a landscape of towering mountains and cavernous valleys, lavish summers and dreary
            winters, rich love and deep pain, a wretch exists on a flat, barren plane of misery. His days are dragged
            through an eternal and ancient darkness that he is doomed to serve. Art, to a wretch, is a depiction of what
            he cannot attain. He studies it with boiling despair and discouragement.

            <br><br>
            A wretch gazes upon the holy gates and perceives the fires of hell. He knows too well his soul is damned and
            cannot find peace in the escape of slumber. Common beauties such as the morning sun are, to a wretch,
            reminders of what greatness could exist if he were not burdened with an undying curse. A wretch’s misery
            ripples through his limbs. When he walks, his legs contort in unnatural motions. He moves with unease and
            unsteadiness. With each step, a wretch treads through the molten tar of their soul: an achievement of
            persistence and grit. Hardship is imbued in a wretch’s spirit. A wretch with a broken leg can climb a
            mountain as fast as any man in good health. Untied by the comforts of man, a wretch can survive extreme
            conditions of weather and distress. He suffers not under man’s delusion of worthiness; he expects no return
            from man, nature, or God.
            <br><br>
            A wretch mourns for no man, and no man mourns for a wretch. In death, a wretch resigns his body to the warm
            earth beneath him. He faces mortality with respect and dignity, being the only kind to comprehend such
            inevitability.
