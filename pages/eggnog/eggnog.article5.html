            Phase 1: The Routine of it All<br>
            While the reality of the situation hasn't fully sunk in yet, your subconscious squirms with apprehension.
            Despite this, the first 15 minutes fail to cause any psychological harm: your routine is enough to distract
            you.
            <br><br>
            Phase 2: Bad Times-a-Brewin<br>
            The monotony of driving begins to settle in. The feeling doesn't dominate your experience, but it drones in
            the back of your minds like a fruit fly. Some good music can take your mind off of it but you know it won't
            last. You know that eventually the dam will reach capacity.

            <br><br>
            Phase 3: Mr. Sandman Tries To Kill You and the People Around You<br>
            Just as the sitting and waiting starts to penetrate your sanity, your sleep deprivation takes priority as
            the main threat. You feel utterly dazed. DAZED FOR GOD'S SAKE! You fear for your safety.
            <br><br>
            Phase 4: Anger Turns to Zen<br>
            The sleepiness passes. Now 30 minutes in, you feel desperately restless. Your legs shake and your head
            aches. Spotify's shuffle fails to shuffle songs and if your a poor soul like me, Spotify has ads. Hate flows
            in your blood. But just as your about to reach your limit, your mind finds a center of focus. Emotions fade
            and you become one with the road.
            <br><br>
            Phase 5: The Final Stretch<br>
            10 miles to the exit. You snap out of your zen state. A desperate yearning builds up inside your mind. LET
            ME OUT LET ME OUT LET ME OUT LET ME OUT and so on.
            <br><br>
            Phase 6: Panic<br>
            You realize you might be late. If you dodge red lights you'll be okay, but there's a decent chance you'll be
            late.
